    <strong><p style="font-size: 0.85em;">As the world hurtles towards greater ecological devastation, inequalities, and
        social conflicts, the biggest question facing us is: are there alternative ways of meeting human needs and
        aspirations, without trashing the earth and without leaving half of humanity behind?</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Across India (as in the rest of the world), this question is being answered by a
            multitude of grassroots and policy initiatives: from meeting basic needs in ecologically sensitive ways to
            decentralised governance and producer-consumer movements, from rethinking urban and rural spaces towards
            sustainability to struggles for social and economic equity. Unfortunately, documentation and public
            awareness of such initiatives in India is poor. There are very few attempts to consolidate and present in
            cohesive manner, the range of these alternatives.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">We offer this website as one response to these gaps. It hopes to feature
            alternatives in the full range of human endeavour as they take place in India, and through this to help
            build bridges amongst them, learn from each other, and together present a challenge to the mainstream
            system. This is part of a larger process in which the co-host organizations are involved, at networking
            alternatives in India and internationally.....</p></strong>
